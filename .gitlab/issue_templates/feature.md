## Acceptance criteria (done when...)

_**Tip**: Write a **checkboxed** list of sentences in the present tense describing the desired state of the system._

**GOOD (clear how to verify, it reports design and interaction decisions
agreed):**

* [ ] The page shows a button only to logged in users
* [ ] The button has the style XXX and label "Logout"
* [ ] When pressed, opens a confirmation modal with "OK" and "Cancel" buttons
* [ ] ...

**BAD (cannot be activated during verification, too arbitrary):**

* [ ] Logout button
* [ ] Modal for confirmation

## Validation scenarios

_**Hint**: Use [Gherkin syntax](https://www.guru99.com/gherkin-test-cucumber.html) to lay them out. It is complete and explicit, human-readable but easy to convert into self-executable tests._

_**Tip**: A scenario title should describe in a complete sentence what happens in that scenario, to improve readability and indability._

**OK**: `Administrator logs into back-office`

**BAD**: `Backoffice login`
